### Root Cause of the Error

The error message `SyntaxError: unterminated string literal (detected at line 6)` indicates that there is a string in the code that is not properly terminated with a closing quote. 

Looking at the relevant code context, the problematic section is:
```python
def check():
    return "h

if __name__ == "__main__": 
    div()
    check()
```

In the `check()` function, the string `"h` is not closed with a matching double quote (`"`). This causes a syntax error because Python expects the string to be properly terminated with another double quote.

### Specific Fix for the Error

To fix the error, terminate the string in the `check()` function with a double quote (`"`).  

Here is the corrected code:
```python
def div():
    print("thi is division meth")
    return 3/0

def check():
    return "h"  # Added closing double quote

if __name__ == "__main__": 
    div()
    check()
```

### Additional Context or Explanation

- Python syntax requires that strings be enclosed in matching quotes (either single `'` or double `"`). An unterminated string will lead to a `SyntaxError`. 
- In the original code, the string was missing a closing `"` to match the opening `"`, making the interpreter think the string continues to the end of the file or until the next `"`.
- The actual line number of the error (`line 6`) might be slightly off depending on the full code, but in the snippet provided, the unterminated string is straightforward to identify and fix. 
- The rest of the code, such as the division by zero (`3/0`), will cause a `ZeroDivisionError` during runtime, but that is unrelated to the initial `SyntaxError` being addressed here. The `SyntaxError` must be resolved first, as it prevents the script from being parsed and run. 

After fixing the `SyntaxError`, if you want to handle the `ZeroDivisionError`, you can wrap the `div()` call in a `try/except` block like this:

```python
try:
    div()
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
``` 

However, that is beyond the scope of the current `SyntaxError` fix. 

### Final Corrected Code (with only syntax fix):
```python
def div():
    print("thi is division meth")
    return 3/0

def check():
    return "h"  # Added closing double quote

if __name__ == "__main__": 
    div()
    check()
```
